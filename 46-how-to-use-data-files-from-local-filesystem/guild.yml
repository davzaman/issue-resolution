  sourcecode:

    # Source code config at the model level applies to all
    # operations. In this case we want to copy all of the text files
    # (the default configuration) but exclude everything under 'data'.

    - exclude: 'data/*'

  operations:
    experiment:

      # The default 'main' attribute is 'experiment' based on the
      # operation name. While we could omit this below, it's good
      # practice to specify it.

      main: experiment

      # In this configuration, we require the project 'data'
      # directory. Guild creates a symbolic link named 'data' to
      # this directory in each run directory for the operation.

      requires:
        - file: data

    experiment-2:
      main: experiment

      # This is an alternative configuration that accomplishes the
      # same thing using a different directory structure. First, the
      # file 'data/file.csv' is selected. Without any additional
      # configuration, Guild creates a link named 'file.csv' in the
      # run directory.
      #
      # However, we also define a 'path' attribute. This tells Guild
      # where links are created within a run directory. In this case,
      # the link 'file.csv' is created in a subdirectory named 'data.
      #
      # Note that this accomplishes the same thing as the previous
      # example, but because the link is to 'file.csv', any other
      # files in the 'data' directory would *not* be available to the
      # run. To make all files under 'data' available, use the
      # configuration for 'experiment' above.

      requires:
        - file: data/file.csv
          path: data

    experiment-3:
      main: experiment

      # In this configuration, we refer to a named resource, which is
      # defined under the 'resources' model attribute. Use named
      # resources when a resource definition is used by more than one
      # operation or to improve the readability of a requires spec.

      requires: data

  resources:
    data:

      # Named resource can be referenced in any operation 'requires'
      # attribute. Here we use the same spec as the requirement for
      # the 'experiment' operation.
      #
      # (Note that as of Guild 0.6.5, named resource sources must be
      # defined under the 'sources' attribute. This requirement will
      # be relaxed in a future release to mirror the structure
      # supported by inline resources.)

      sources:
        - file: data
