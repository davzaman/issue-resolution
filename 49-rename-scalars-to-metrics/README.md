# Rename scalars to metrics

https://github.com/guildai/guildai/issues/49

## Problem

The term *scalar* used in Guild's feature set means "floating point
values, optionally associated with an integer step, generated by a
run". This term comes from TensorFlow's *scalar summaries*, which is
how Guild reads these values.

Guild supports mapping of script output to scalar values by way of
`output-scalars` configuration.

This terminology could be clarified using the term *metric* instead of
scalar.

## Counterpoint

There's no evidence yet that *scalar* is confusing anyone.

There's also the matter of non-metric scalar values, such as
performance metrics (e.g. under Guild's `sys/` tag namespace). If
users define configuration under `output-metrics`, what of these
non-metric values?

## Decision

This is on hold until we have more information confirming this as an
actual problem.
